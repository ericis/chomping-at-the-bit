The Bit Imagining the flow of bits and bytes in a computer system might invoke images from a movie like \"The Matrix\". The bit is the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. The name is a portmanteau of binary digit. The bit represents a logical state with one of two possible values. These values are most commonly represented as either \"1\" or \"0\" , but other representations such as true/false , yes/no , +/\u2212 , or on/off are commonly used. Improving digital experiences with technology at your company may offer new and expanded opportunities every year. The inherent complexity and challenges can be daunting though. Beyond the \"bit\", unlocking the value of technology rarely presents itself as a binary decision or solution, but as a vast collection of concerns and dependencies. It is interesting that the \"bit\" in the equestrian world, is a tool that helps connect a rider and a horse, aiding in communication and directing the horse's path. For horses, \"bit chomping\" or \"bit champing\" may indicate an issue with size, shape and fit, but often indicates that the horse is nervous, anxious, or impatient about something. If a person is \"chomping / champing at the bit\", they are very impatient to do something, but they are prevented from doing it, usually by circumstances that they have no control over. Digital value delivery with technology affords us this experience every day! Business and technology experts alike have incredible ideas about the value they would like to deliver to customers, but run into roadblocks and obstacles along the way; developers experience this constantly during implementation while iterating over small coding experiments that grow into full-fledged features and capabilities.

Now, we look at the lifecycle of value delivery and how they influence strategy. Capabilities live in only one stage of the lifecycle, but because Business Capability Models define aggregate capabilites at multiple levels of granularity, a higher level capability may contain capabilities that live in multiple stages of the lifecycle. In other words, a \"Digital Commerce\" capability will have many fine-grained capabilities that may each exist their own lifecycle stage. Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) are an important tool in measuring the success of a capability in a specific lifecycle stage. Explore For capabilities that are completely new to an organization or challenge the core competencies of an organization, including value experiments, the four resources are focused on iterative experimentation; working with unknowns and forming value hypotheses that must be tested by using measurable results. Teams tend to grow during this stage. Enhance Once established, a capability may require more or less investment and experimentation to improve and maximize value delivery. However, these experiments are usually somewhat constrained by existing investments across people, processes, and technology . Certain standards and conventions are established to optimize the value stream that may improve or hinder the organization's ability to change. Teams may grow or shrink in this stage. Sustain Well-established capabilities are often moved to a \"keep the lights on\" lifecycle stage of maintenance; fixing issues on a constrained budget investment. Teams tend to shrink in this stage. Retire Some investment and focus is necessary to fully retire a capability from the business portfolio. Teams often shrink in this stage, but may actually require growth if \"Sustain\" investments were already incredibly lean and more effort is required to retire the capability. Conclusions Technology impacts While a business capability may have a distinct lifecycle stage of investment, supporting technology may force a lifecycle change. For example, older technology that is difficult to maintain or even no longer supported by a vendor may force a \"Sustain\" capability's technology into \"Explore\" and \"Enhance\" for a replacement solution and may require supporting redundant capabilities until the transition can be completed. Because technology is such an important resource for business, its impacts to the lifecycle must be communicated, understood, and planned for. Of course, technology opportunities may also afford a business opportunity and lifecycle change too. Redundant business capabilities due to technology solutions are increasingly frequent the larger the organization, especially across Software as a Service (SaaS) and Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COtS) software solutions from vendors. For example, the capabilities of technology that support Collaboration and Knowledge Management regularly overlap in features and function. Great organizations empower teams to make decisions that are best for the team while providing some level of governance / guidance that improves informed team decision making across the enterprise. While three teams may all want to choose collaboration software solutions from three different vendors, it is important to recognize all of the opportunities and risks across the enterprise toward optimizing and improving vendor management, pricing and licensing (e.g. volume discounts), partnerships, contract negotations and renewals (e.g. organizational leverage), budgeting and accounting, and more. Explore, Enhance, Sustain and Retire The influence of People across these stages can radically affect organizational structure and possibly even strategy. For example, if an individual \"lives for innovation\", they may have difficulty transitioning their work from \"Explore\" to \"Enhance\" or \"Sustain\". This behavior can result in \"shiny object syndrome\" and chasing \"newness\" within an organization, creating staffing challenges. Research suggests that long-lived product teams of people may deliver the best results, but an organization must wrestle with the challenges of establishing long-lived capabilities with long-lived domain expertise against moving people across capabilities. Being intentional with strategy by explicitly acknowledging shifts forward and backward across these four lifecycle stages provides a temporal perspective on investment decision making.

Why would we bring these three together and for what purpose? What is their mission or \"just cause\" as Simon Sinek might put it? Value Everything an organization does can be tied back to a value proposition or hypothesis. Like any experiment, the result may be failure. Even wasteful activities that started with a specific context of intentions, assumptions and expectations may have been wrong to begin with, wrong in hindsight or retrospect, or the context has changed and partially or completely no longer applies. The goal, of course, is to maximize value delivery and minimize waste. Customer value is often assumed, but it could be wrong to jump to the conclusion that priority is always given to a customer's value, because there are often many important stakeholders concerned with their own definitions of \"value\" as well as unique value delivery concerns. Operating an organization means prioritizing, balancing and maximizing value delivery across all concerned stakeholders. People Most every organization has people leaders and management. Looking for opportunities through the lens of \"People\" can offer unique insights into team structuring, telecommuting or \"work from home\", diversity and inclusion, talent management including recruiting, upskilling and reskilling, internships and returnships and more. Conway's Law Creating organizational structures around people, uninformed explicitly by the technology roadmap can result in \"Conway's Law\". \"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure.\" \u2014\u2009Melvin E. Conway Organizations, especially large enterprises, often struggle with the reality of Conway's Law and the negative friction it can introduce to digital value delivery. Organizations may apply the \"Inverse Conway Maneuver\" by working closely with their systems designers / architects and technology leaders as well as using tools like Team Topologies . Stephen Covey stated this simply in Habit 2 of \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" as \"begin with the end in mind.\" People excellence People leadership has evolved out of traditional top-down management and is well-established through the practice of organizational management and leadership. Because people are uniquely complex, especially when scaling from an individual to an enterprise, and they exist in an evolving world of generations, each leadership context offers its own distinct insights with many paths leading toward varying degrees of success. Generally, people want to be valued, to be personally connected to the value they are generating for an organization, and to be recognized for their contributions. Process Approaches toward optimizing value delivery processes have continued to evolve out of the traditional \"Waterfall Model\" with involved process improvement practices like Six Sigma and into variations of Agile, Scrum, Lean, Kanban and others including adapting improvement frameworks like Lean Six Sigma. Establishing the Agile Manifesto brought a sense of unity to process discussions and possibly improved the probability of organizations being willing to change and try something new. Improving value delivery with tools like Value-Stream mapping with prioritized focus and iterative improvements can pay great dividends. Process excellence Process leadership has generally focused on tighter and leaner value delivery models that offer earlier feedback for what is working and what is not. The technology \"DevOps\" movement refers to this earlier feedback cycle as \"shift left\", where the spectrum of value delivery is designed and developed on the left-hand side of the scale and and is realized on the right; where possible, important feedback to inform decision making is gathered earlier toward value design and development. Technology Technology is a vital asset to most businesses today, giving rise to the \"digital enterprise\" and \"digital transformation\" efforts. Technology is most useful when end-users and stakeholders alike agree that it provides value for them now. Past value quickly results in a liability for organizations while future value predictions are experiments, behaving like a stock option that may or may not yield a return on investment. Experimenting with value delivery improvements and value propositions to end users can be an asset that informs investments, but non-production value, i.e. value that is not yet available to end users, is a liability to the organization until it is delivered. Technology excellence There are many forms of technology leadership in an organization. Utilized effectively in an enterprise, the diversity of expertise can breed tremendous innovation. In practice, the boundaries for decision making get blurred across roles from developers and engineers to designers and architects to management and leadership as well as other technology consultants and experts. Some of the best tools for managing technology leadership concerns may come from the practice of architecture including the roles of Enterprise, Business, Solutions, Experience, Software and Application, Data and Information, and Infrastructure Architecture. The designers of an organization's technology are many and often do not hold the title \"designer\" or \"architect\". The consequences of decision making may result in unanticipated opportunities as well as challenges for the future. Conclusions Value, People, Process and Technology Great solutions need to account for and balance opportunities and risks across all of these four resources; improving value delivery by investing in people through iterative process with the right technology.

For a few examples, see LeanIx , LucidChart , Capstera , and BMC .

P. Box Business Capability Models are often defined as a hierarchy with increasing granularity from top tiers down to the actual individual capabilities and functions created and supported by value delivery teams. Models are often ideal, abstract or even theoretical, making it difficult to cleanly map each capability to the reality of complex organizational concerns. For example, multiple technology systems may all contribute to a unique aspect of a single capability or even provide redundant capabilities. Similarly, delivery teams and organization structures may have \"shared ownership\" of one or more capabilities, creating unwanted friction because of value delivery dependencies. Classifying and visualizing capabilities It can be helpful to consider how customers or end-users interact with digital value. What channels expose the value to them? How do they experience value? What capabilities deliver value? And, what platforms enable those capabilities to be built and maintained? Digital Channels Like marketing channels , what digital channels expose one or more digital experiences to a user? Some Examples Web Native Personal Devices, like Mobile E-mail Voice Chat \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) devices (e.g. robots, home devices, etc.) Etc. Digital Experiences How does a person interface and interact with the digital product or service? \"Journeys\" can be a synonym for experiences. Some Examples Customer Digital Experiences like Digital Commerce \"Buy\" and \"Sell\" Associate / Employee Digital Experiences like onboarding, way finding, sales, customer support, etc. Developer Digital Experiences like infrastructure provisioning, DevOps pipelines and toolchains, operations, support, etc. Etc. Digital Capabilities What digital capabilities enable an end-to-end digital experience? Some Examples \"Accepting payment\" for digital commerce customers Product catalog listings for digital retail Digital knowledge management search for associates Managed DevOps pipelines for developers Etc. Digital Platforms What digital platforms support building, delivering, and operating digital capabilities? Some Examples Cloud platforms Digital Commerce Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Collaboration and Knowledge Management DevOps toolchains Etc. Organizational structure We briefly touched on the pitfalls of focusing too much on People when designing organizational structures with Conway's Law. The realities and influence of organizational \"politics\" cannot be ignored. We also highlighted that Team Topologies is an excellent resource for structuring team and team interactions. However, we must emphasize the importance of understanding both current and desired Business Capabilities along with the Technology strategy to inform successful organizational structure decisions. It may seem obvious, but the evolution of Process toward agility and continuous improvement suggests that an organizational structure must also change, but carefully consider the frequency and impacts of change. Conclusions Experiences, Channels, Capabilities and Platforms These four structures aid in communicating and evolving an organization's capabilities to inform organizational structure and to provide a common language that clarifies, unites and aligns strategy.
